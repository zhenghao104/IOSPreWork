## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
As I do not have many programming experience, building this calculator is a difficult but fun experience. As first I have
trouble learning how Xcode and swift work on building an application as it is unlike Java that I learned before. Instead of 
plainly writing code we can press CTRL keys and link the user interface to the swift code. It is a foreign environment to me
for the way of building an application as we can simply adjust the user interface by creating shapes. Overall writing an IOS
application is fun and I am looking forward to learn more of it.
